# Prime Multiplication Table

Prime number multiplication table! :)

## Usage

After cloning the code, convert it to a jar file and execute. You can also do a small shell script that does the java -jar call for you.

```bash
lein uberjar
java -jar <uberjar-standalone-file> <optional-n>
```
Without the optional-n, you will get a multiplication table of 10 primes. If you specify n, you will get that many primes.
